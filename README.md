# Home Ops

This will replace the deleted `k3s-ops` repository in the comming months. I have slowly migrated everything over to `nix` and `ansible`.

Currently the infrastucture consists of a file server (FreeBSD), router (Mikrotik), and the Turing Pi 2 (NixOS). There are other things throughout, however these are the main participants.
